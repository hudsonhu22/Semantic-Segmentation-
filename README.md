# Semantic-Segmentation-

The notebook contains a neural network designed for semantic segmentation of retina cells. The model produces a binary mask to segment the retina cell in white from its background in black. The custom convolutional neural network relies on the linked data from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahwagih/retina-blood-vessel.
